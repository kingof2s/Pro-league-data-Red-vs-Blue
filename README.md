# Pro-league-data-Red-vs-Blue
Used in dsc80 project 3 

Our dataset for this project is the set of all professional League of Legends games played, beginning in 2014. 
Each game of league of legends is played on a diagonal asymmetrical map, which roughly looks like ![map not found](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/53/Summoner%27s_Rift_Update_Map.png/revision/latest?cb=20170223053555)
While the map layout has changed slightly over the years (something we will discuss later), it has generally remained consistent throughout the years. There are 2 teams of 5 players each, the blue team which starts on the bottom left of the map, and the red team which starts on the top right of the map. As we can see, this map is asymmetrical, meaning that there are differences between playing on the red and blue side.

We wanted to take a look at how those differences affect pro matches by asking the question:
